# Challenge of front-end for Olist (by Yuri Conte)
This is my project for the Olist front-end challenge.

## Installing / Getting started
Because it is a simple project, no procedure is required for project installation.

Just access the root folder and run index.html

## Developing

### Built With
HTML, JavaScript and CSS

### Prerequisites
The only requirement to run this project is a current browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge or IE 10)

The project has not been tested on older versions of browsers

### Setting up Dev
To configure this project in your local environment, simply clone this repository, access the "project" folder and run the "index.html" file.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/yuriconte/work-at-olist-front.git
cd work-at-olist-front/project/
```

### Building
This project does not require build. Just run the .html files

### Deploying / Publishing
This project does not require build. Just run the .html files

```shell
packagemanager deploy your-project -s server.com -u username -p password
```

And again you'd need to tell what the previous code actually does.
